            "text": "SW startup guide for Vayu GPS\n\n\nThe Vayu-2GP-A, Vayu-3GHP-A, VAYU-3GCP-A and VAYU-P capes come with a GPS module. For a quick guide to starting with the Vayu-P cape's HW, see \n\nLeaflet for P cape.\n\n\nBelow, we describe how to set up the GPS portion of the VAYU capes and the associated software.\n\n\nHardware Instructions\n\n\nIt has following interfaces available to user and for connecting to Beaglebone Black :\n\n\n\n\nUART4 (/dev/ttyO4):\n It is used for reading the GPS NMEA messages from UART port of GPS module. It should be configured for use at baud rate 19200 raw after ttyO4 has been enabled in the kernel by applying device tree overlay for UART4.\n\n\nGPIO50:\n It is used for resetting the GPS modules. It should be pulled high all the time.\n\n\nGPIO27 :\n It is used as an input GPIO to receive 1 PPS output from the GPS module.\n\n\nSwitch S3 on Cape :\n It is push button Reset switch. To reset the module , push this button for atleast 1 sec or set the reset GPIO50 low for atleast 1 sec.\n\n\nLED D5 on Cape:\nIt is GPS fix LED of the GPS Module. When the Module has acquired GPS fix, this LED starts blinking at 1s OFF/1s ON . Also 1PPS output can be detected at GPIO27 after that.\n\n\nLED D7 on Cape :\n It is 3.3V power LED for cape. It indicates that the GPS module is powered on.\n\n\n\n\nConnect the GPS antenna at SMA connector P6 and place the antenna under open sky for better operations and Boot up Beaglebone Black with cape mounted on it. Notice LED D7 powering up.\n\n\nDepending on the GPS module had a cold start, warm start or hot start , You should soon see LED D5 to start blinking, denoting that GPS Fix has been acquired.\n\n\nUsing GPS module with Debian Wheezy\n\n\nTo read the NMEA messages from the GPS Module on Beaglebone Black :\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable UART4 (/dev/ttyO4) in device tree kernel. \n\n\n# cd /lib/firmware\n\n# echo BB-UART4 \n /sys/devices/bone_capemgr.9/slots''\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can read the slots or use dmesg to see that UART4 has been enabled.\n\n\n# cat /sys/devices/bone_capemgr.9/slots''\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput will be like this :\n\n\n    ''0: 54:PF---''\n    ''1: 55:PF---''\n    ''2: 56:PF---''\n    ''3: 57:PF---''\n    ''4: ff:P-O-L Bone-LT-eMMC-2G,00A0,Texas Instrument,BB-BONE-EMMC-2G''\n    ''5: ff:P-O-L Bone-Black-HDMI,00A0,Texas Instrument,BB-BONELT-HDMI''\n    ''7: ff:P-O-L Override Board Name,00A0,Override Manuf,BB-UART4''\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall Minicom or use the following commands to see NMEA messages\n# apt-get install minicom''\n\n# minicom \u2013s'' (port settings /dev/ttyO4 19200 8N1 )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor\n\n\n    # stty \u2013F /dev/ttyO4 19200 raw''\n    #cat /dev/ttyO4''\n\n\n\nFor more information and detailed guide on Time synchronization and GPS Location , please refer to the App note - \n\nGPS Location and time synchronization",
